    <h1>Hippie Crap</h1>

  <h2>A little less sucky.</h2>


  <p>You often hear the rich say money doesn’t matter, the beautiful say beauty doesn’t matter, and the famous say fame doesn’t matter. Pretending to believe this hippie crap is stupid because somewhere out there, a woman didn’t make it past her job interview due to the imperfections on her face and a guy got dumped for being broke. 
However dull it may sound, the “beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder” shit is not saintly it’s tragic. Yes, it is a sentence to use when your girl says there’s nothing she sees in herself as beautiful but it’s also the reason why the woman from the third line didn’t get a job. External beauty matters even though it shouldn’t. Broad minded perspectives aren’t yet common around us and that’s sad. This biasness delays, if not completely stops progress of individuals being a little less sucky than before. 
Money is a big deal. I don’t really earn so if your ego complex is crossing the international space station, I’m sorry. But here’s a thing I think is true about “money doesn’t matter.” Uncertainty is the only certainty we see around us and you’ll never know how you landed in the ICU when the last thing you remembered doing was writing a blog about hippie craps. There are so many bills a person has to pay for existing that if you don’t earn enough you might just consider dying rather than getting your testicular cancer treated. Again, this is just one example of many scenarios where money is the real deal.
So in a nutshell, if you feel the beauty biasness, tweet about it and if you don’t have money, get a plastic surgery and maybe you’ll see a difference.
